# Sweet HIbiscus Drink Product Label

## Project Overview

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification course. The original task is titled "Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label," but I have personalized and customized it to create a product label for a sweetened Hibiscus drink known as "Zobo" in Nigeria.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to learn and apply typography principles in web design by creating a visually appealing and informative product label. The label includes various elements such as the product name, brand logo, ingredients, usage instructions, warnings, and a barcode.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the label.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout, ensuring the label is visually appealing and easy to read.

## Goals

- **Typography**: Apply principles of typography to create a readable and attractive label.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the label looks good on different devices and screen sizes.

## Usage

To view the product label, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The label should display all the relevant information and design elements as described.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical application of typography and responsive web design principles, customized to create a unique and informative product label for the Zobo drink.

# Posters Collection Site

This project is a web application designed to showcase my design exploration during a typographic design challenge. The challenge involved creating different forms of alphabets and digits by incorporating various African elements into the designs.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this site is to present my creative process and the final designs that emerged from the challenge. Each poster highlights unique typographic styles that blend traditional African motifs with modern design principles.

## Features

- Display a collection of typographic posters
- Highlight the inspiration and process behind each design
- Responsive design for an optimal viewing experience on both mobile and desktop devices

## Vision

Through this project, I aim to celebrate African culture and its rich visual heritage by integrating it into contemporary typography. The posters serve not only as a portfolio of my work but also as a tribute to the diverse and vibrant artistic traditions of Africa.

Feel free to explore the posters and get inspired by the fusion of typography and African aesthetics.
